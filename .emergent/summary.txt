<analysis>**original_problem_statement:** 
The user wants to build an AI-first web app called **Executive Presence (EP) Quotient**. This application will allow corporate leaders to upload or record a 3-minute video of themselves speaking. The app will then analyze the video and provide a detailed report on their executive presence.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   **Authentication:** Google Sign-In and JWT-based (email/password) options.
-   **Core Tabs:** The app must have five main sections: Know your EP, Simulator, Learning Bytes, Training, and Executive Coaching.
-   **Know your EP Flow:** A guided process for video upload/recording, processing, and viewing the final report. The report must be downloadable as a PDF.
-   **AI Analysis Dimensions:** The analysis is based on four weighted dimensions: Gravitas (25%), Communication (35%), Presence (25%), and Storytelling (15%). Each dimension is composed of several specific parameters (e.g., speaking rate, eye contact, narrative structure).
-   **AI Pipeline:** Use OpenAI for all AI tasks, including speech-to-text (Whisper), vision analysis (GPT-4o), and NLP scoring (GPT-4o).
-   **UI/UX:** A modern, minimal, corporate, and premium visual design. The user is very specific about wanting a professional golden aesthetic.
-   **Feature Tabs:**
    -   **Simulator:** A Boardroom Simulator with challenging scenarios for users to practice responses.
    -   **Learning Bytes:** Daily tips and expert advice.
    -   **Training:** Structured micro-courses based on the user's weak areas.
    -   **Executive Coaching:** A call-to-action to book coaching sessions.
- **Personalization:** A profiling system should be implemented after login to tailor the AI analysis based on the user's role (e.g., CTO, Manager).

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend has been developed. The project structure includes backend services for AI analysis (transcription, vision, NLP), JWT authentication, a user profiling system, and database models. The frontend has pages for Landing, Auth (Login/Signup), Dashboard, and placeholders for the main features. A premium golden aesthetic has been applied to the Landing and Auth pages, and an OpenAI API key provided by the user has been integrated into the backend.

**Last working item**: 
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was addressing user feedback about a cluttered Dashboard UI and loading failures for several feature pages. The user pointed out that the top navigation tabs were redundant with the cards on the dashboard and that the Simulator, Learning Bytes, Training, and Executive Coaching pages were all failing to load.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? both
    - User Testing Done: Y

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Backend:** FastAPI
-   **Frontend:** React
-   **Database:** MongoDB (with GridFS for video storage)
-   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
-   **AI:** OpenAI API (GPT-4o for analysis, Whisper for transcription)
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

**key DB schema**
  - **users**: 
  - **videos**: 
  - **profiles**: 
  - **reports**: (Implicitly exists, created on-the-fly from analysis results)

**changes in tech stack**
  - None

**All files of reference**
-   : Main FastAPI application, contains all API routes.
-   : Contains the MongoDB URL and the user-provided .
-   : The core service that orchestrates the entire AI analysis pipeline.
-   : The main landing page, which has undergone significant UI changes.
-   : The login page, also heavily styled.
-   : The main user dashboard, currently a point of focus for bug fixes and UI improvements.
-   : Axios configuration for all frontend API calls.
-   : Global CSS file containing theme variables for the golden aesthetic.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **CSS Implementation:** The agent resorted to using inline styles and overwriting entire files () to fix UI issues. This suggests a problem with the Tailwind CSS setup or CSS cascade. This should be refactored to use CSS classes for better maintainability.
-   **Authentication Flow:** The frontend authentication state management is brittle, causing a persistent login redirect loop. This flow needs to be reviewed and made more robust, likely by improving state management in React.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Creates a new user.
-   : Authenticates a user and returns a token.
-   : Creates or updates a user's profile.
-   : Uploads a video for analysis.
-   : Gets the status of a video processing job.
-   : Fetches content for the Learning Bytes page.
-   : Fetches content for the Training page.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **UI is paramount:** The user is extremely focused on the UI/UX. The premium golden aesthetic seen on the login/landing pages is the approved design language and must be applied consistently everywhere. Do not deviate from this style.
-   **Use User's API Key:** All AI-related API calls must use the  provided by the user, which is stored in . The initial plan to use the  is obsolete.
-   **Fix Critical Bugs First:** Before implementing new features, prioritize fixing the loading errors on the feature pages and the login redirect loop. The app is currently unusable for end-users.
-   **Personalized Analysis is Key:** The user profiling system is a core requirement. Ensure all AI analysis prompts in the backend services correctly incorporate the user's role (e.g., CTO, Manager) to tailor the results.
