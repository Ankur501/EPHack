<analysis>**original_problem_statement:** 
The user wants to build an AI-first web app called **Executive Presence (EP) Quotient**. This application will allow corporate leaders to upload or record a 3-minute video of themselves speaking. The app will then analyze the video and provide a detailed report on their executive presence.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   **Authentication:** Google Sign-In and JWT-based (email/password) options.
-   **Core Tabs:** The app must have five main sections: Know your EP, Simulator, Learning Bytes, Training, and Executive Coaching.
-   **Know your EP Flow:** A guided process for video upload/recording, processing, and viewing the final report. The report must be downloadable as a PDF.
-   **AI Analysis Dimensions:** The analysis is based on four weighted dimensions: Gravitas (25%), Communication (35%), Presence (25%), and Storytelling (15%). Each dimension is composed of several specific parameters (e.g., speaking rate, eye contact, narrative structure).
-   **AI Pipeline:** Use OpenAI for all AI tasks, including speech-to-text (Whisper), vision analysis (GPT-4o), and NLP scoring (GPT-4o).
-   **UI/UX:** A modern, minimal, corporate, and premium visual design. The user is very specific about wanting a professional golden aesthetic.
-   **Feature Tabs:**
    -   **Simulator:** A Boardroom Simulator with challenging scenarios for users to practice responses.
    -   **Learning Bytes:** Daily tips and expert advice, to be AI-generated.
    -   **Training:** Structured micro-courses based on the user's weak areas, to be AI-generated.
    -   **Executive Coaching:** A call-to-action to book coaching sessions (via Calendly link) and an internal request form.
- **Personalization:** A profiling system should be implemented after login to tailor the AI analysis based on the user's role (e.g., CTO, Manager).

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend. The major blocking issues from the previous session have been resolved. The login redirect loop is fixed, the Learning Bytes and Training pages now load with dynamically AI-generated content, and the dashboard navigation has been cleaned up. The backend now includes new API routes for handling executive coaching requests and creating shareable links for reports. The basic structure for all five core features exists, and the golden aesthetic is applied to the main auth and dashboard pages.

**Last working item**: 
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was preparing to run a full end-to-end test of the recent fixes and new features. It finished updating the  file with instructions for the testing agent to validate the authentication flow, the new AI-generated content on the Learning and Training pages, the new Executive Coaching request endpoint, and the new report sharing functionality.

**key DB schema**
  - **users**: 
  - **videos**: 
  - **profiles**: 
  - **coaching_requests**:  (New)
  - **shared_reports**:  (New)

**changes in tech stack**
  - None

**All files of reference**
-   : Main FastAPI application, recently modified to include new routers and AI-powered content endpoints.
-   : UI updated to remove redundant navigation.
-   : Contains the main React Router configuration, updated with the new  route.
-   : New file containing the logic for coaching requests.
-   : New file for creating and retrieving shareable report links.
-   : New frontend page to display a shared report.
-   : Updated with instructions for the next testing phase.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **Backend Routes:** The agent started refactoring  by moving routes into dedicated files (, ). This should be continued for other routes (e.g., profile, video, auth) to keep  clean.
-   **CSS Implementation:** The golden aesthetic is still applied inconsistently, with some reliance on inline styles. This should be refactored to use Tailwind CSS classes and a centralized theme configuration for better maintainability.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Authenticates a user and returns a token.
-   : Verifies a token and returns user data.
-   : Uploads a video for analysis.
-   : **(New)** Fetches an AI-generated daily tip.
-   : **(New)** Fetches the list of AI-powered training modules.
-   : **(New)** Fetches AI-generated content for a specific module.
-   : **(New)** Submits a request for executive coaching.
-   : **(New)** Creates a shareable link for a report.
-   : **(New)** Retrieves a shared report's data.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Run Tests First:** The immediate next step is to execute a full test using the testing agent, following the instructions in . This will validate all recent fixes and uncover any regressions before proceeding.
-   **Verify Video Pipeline:** A key part of the upcoming test is to verify the end-to-end video processing pipeline. Pay close attention to its stability.
-   **UI Consistency:** The premium golden aesthetic is a critical user requirement. After testing, continue applying this theme consistently across all remaining pages (, , , etc.).
